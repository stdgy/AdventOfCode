System of equations we need to solve. They must all equal 0.

(t + 2) % 5 == 0
((t + 1) + 7) % 13  == 0

3, 8, 13, 18...
5, 18, 31, ...

(t + 2) % 5 = ((t + 1) + 7) % 13 

Algorithm:

Given N equations.
Take first equation.

For each result from first equation:
    Check if result is common to every other equation.
        If it is, return it.
